# Methods argument(method_argument.rb)
 - optional argument(supply same number of arguments)
 - default value argument ()
 - parameter argument

# Classes and Instances
 - Instance method (It is defining method directly on individual object)
 - Overriding method (It is defining same method call twice in same class)
 - Reopenint method(It is defining same class definie multiple times)

# Setter method
 - Equal sign method
   -In this method create a instance variable and assign all the values in object creations time.
 - Synthetic sugar method
   -{#........####}
 - Setter unleashed method

# Attributes and the attr_* method family
 - An attribute is an property of object whose value cand be read and weite through object.

# Inhritance
 - In inheritance one class occuipied all the properties of another class.
 - Single inheritance

# Class as object and message
 - Creating a class as object (my_class = Class.new)
 - class Ticket
     some_message
 - Ticket.some_message

# Module creation
 - Module creation is same as class creation only difference is in class use class variable and in module use module keyword.
 # Mixin module
  - Ruby doesn't support multiple inheritance, so that ruby module have another module mixin.
 # Mixing in two modules with same name.
  - Like class in method which method is  defined in second module that takes precedence.
  - To solve this problem Super keywords used.
  - Using super you can call the recent method.
